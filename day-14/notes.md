# Day 14 — Short Day (Book Recommendation System Revision)

Today was a light day. I only had time to briefly revise the **Book Recommendation System** project that I had worked on earlier.

The revision mainly involved refreshing:

- how the dataset was processed
- how similarity scores were computed
- how recommendations were generated

No new code additions or changes today — just revisiting the concept and refreshing the workflow mentally.

Some days are heavier, some lighter. The important part is to keep the streak going.
