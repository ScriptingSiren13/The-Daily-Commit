# Day 14 — Short Day (Book Recommendation System Revision)

Today was a light day. I only had time to briefly revise the **Book Recommendation System** project that I had worked on earlier.

The revision mainly involved refreshing:

- how the dataset was processed
- how similarity scores were computed
- how recommendations were generated

No new code additions or changes today — just revisiting the concept and refreshing the workflow mentally.


## Google Arcade (296 Boot Boost)

In addition, I started exploring **Google Arcade**, specifically the **296 Boot Boost** labs. For now, just checking out the platform, how the labs are structured, and what challenges exist. I’ll attempt solving the labs and continue progressively.

More detailed notes will come once I get deeper into the labs.
