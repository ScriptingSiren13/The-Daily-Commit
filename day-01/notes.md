# Day 01 — Starting Point

Today marks the beginning of my 365-day consistency journey in AI backend engineering.

What I did today:
- Created the repository and base folder structure
- Defined rules for daily commits
- Clarified the purpose of this repo as a long-term learning log, not a showcase of perfect projects

Intent going forward:
- Use this repository as a daily engineering journal
- Capture learnings through notes, small code snippets, experiments, and architecture thoughts
- Avoid over-optimizing or over-polishing; focus on showing up every day

Important note to self:
This repository is not limited to a single technology or tool.
It will evolve based on what I am learning or building on any given day.
Consistency and clarity matter more than scope.
