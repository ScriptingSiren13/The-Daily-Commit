# Day 23 — Light Progress (Tkinter: Color Dialog Dialogs)

Didn’t get much time today, but continued the Tkinter journey by exploring how **color dialog boxes** work. Specifically studied how Tkinter allows the user to visually pick a color and return that selection back to the application via the built-in color chooser module.

###  What I Studied Today

- Tkinter provides a color selection dialog through `colorchooser`
- The dialog shows a palette and lets the user confirm or cancel
- The selected color is returned both as:
  - an RGB tuple, and
  - a HEX code string
- Tkinter primarily uses the HEX string for UI coloring

###  Why This is Useful

This mechanism is commonly used in apps that allow users to customize visuals, such as:

- paint applications
- theme settings
- drawing/editing tools
- UI/UX customization features

###  Repo Work

Uploaded the code example for testing the color dialog to my **Tkinter repo**, where I am collecting hands-on widgets and UI experiments.
