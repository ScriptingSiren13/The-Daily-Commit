# 365 Days of AI Backend

This repository documents my daily progress, learning, and thinking in AI backend engineering.

It serves as a personal engineering journal where I track:
- What I study and revise
- What I experiment with
- What I design and reason about
- What I build, break, or attempt to build

The goal of this repository is consistency and clarity — not perfection or polished outcomes.

## Possible Areas (not strict limits)

The topics covered here may include, but are not limited to:

- AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning concepts
- LLMs, LangChain, and agentic AI systems
- Python programming and software fundamentals
- Backend engineering concepts and API design
- FastAPI and general backend frameworks
- Databases and data handling (SQL / NoSQL)
- Authentication, authorization, and security concepts
- System design and backend architecture
- Experiments, proofs of concept, and learning notes
- Any concept relevant to building real-world AI-backed systems

## Rules

- One meaningful commit every day
- Code, notes, architecture, and experiments all count
- Focus on understanding over speed
- Consistency over intensity

This repository is intentionally flexible and will evolve as my skills and interests grow.
