# Day 33 — Project Revision & Interview Preparation

## Overview
Today was largely focused on **revision and consolidation** rather than learning new concepts, as I had an interview scheduled. Most of my time went into revisiting previously completed projects to strengthen understanding and prepare for discussion-based questions.

## 1. Project Revision — PyTorch Project

I revised one of my projects built using **PyTorch**, focusing on:
- understanding the overall project flow
- revisiting the model architecture and training pipeline
- refreshing concepts related to tensors, forward pass, loss computation, and optimization
- preparing clear explanations of design choices and implementation decisions

The goal was to be confident in explaining both *what* was done and *why* it was done that way.

## 2. Project Revision — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

I also revised an **EDA-based project**, concentrating on:
- data understanding and problem framing
- data cleaning and preprocessing steps
- visualizations used to extract insights
- interpretation of patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data

This helped reinforce how raw data is transformed into meaningful insights.

## 3. Interview Preparation

A significant portion of the day was spent:
- preparing for an interview
- revising core concepts linked to my projects
- mentally structuring explanations for technical and conceptual questions

This revision helped improve clarity, confidence, and articulation during discussions.

## Reflection

Today was about **reinforcement, not speed**.  
Revisiting existing projects helped:
- strengthen conceptual understanding
- improve the ability to explain work clearly
- connect theory with practical implementation

Even without new development work, the day contributed meaningfully to overall growth and interview readiness.
